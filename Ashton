Stalk their social media

Some of the older posts icks you, should you confront them?
"Yes" or "No"

When you confront them, they tell you that the post you saw was them before, but they’ve changed now. What do you do?

Decide that this is the time to ask out ashton

Or

Never speak to them again


You stop talking to them, they’re hurt but move on
